1. story why I want to do project: I like online shopping, but not always can I get most suitable things appearing in the top of the search list
2. Ads - Step: (1) data, learn how to crawl data from amazon, store on a cache (2)use these data to let users search conveniently for these product (3)user experience, I implemented some machine learning algorithm to show users more relevant ads.
using machine learning algorithms:
1. we need to rewrite query. nike running shoes -> nike sneakers
query rewrite to get more relevant query
1000 product data -> title，query，category，campaign id，price，image url，cost per click，query group，key word，ad id, detailed url
extract "query and title", using lucene libray functions to clean
training data: these query and title pairs
word2vector
output: a model (a single vector containnig, for every input word, the probability that each word would appear near the input word)

2.we need to predict user's click probility towards an ad
we don't have user's search log, so I simulate a log by myself
taking many factors into consideration, some relevant to users, some to ads, for example, user ID, group ID, compaign ID
then I used 7-10 features to do offline training
here I use logistic regression to train a model, to get every feature's weight

then if user click online, combine users and ads to get features and use my model to calculate their click probability
then rank these ads according user's click probability

inverted index：
    key是term
    value 是List<Id>
    给一个ad，把里面的keyword tokenize，然后把里面每个term拿出来。并且找到对应的ad id，然后插入到这个term的list里面。inverted index需要使用memcache
